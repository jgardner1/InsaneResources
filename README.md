# Description

Overrides the distribution of resources so that they are all alike and they
create HUGE patches of INSANE depth.

This is NOT RSO. RSO does a lot of work to spread things out the further you
go away from base. I had a hard time getting RSO to do what I wanted, and I
have no idea why. I just wanted to crank up the resources to "Very, Very,
Very Low", "Insanely Huge", and "Insanely Rich".

# TODO

Not much. Maybe figure out a way to spread things out a little more.

I'd like to tweak the starting area so as to make sure all three resources are
available in their proper proportions.
